# CRUX Demo Site

A clean, interactive demonstration of the CRUX cognitive architecture framework.

## What is CRUX?

CRUX is a modular cognitive AI framework built in Rust that enables dynamic composition of AI "minds" through a secure plugin architecture. The framework supports real-time cognitive pipelines, persistent memory systems, and multi-language bindings.

- `index.html` - Main landing page with overview and features
- `crux_interactive_docs.html` - Interactive cognitive processing demonstration

## Features

### Interactive Cognitive Processing
- Enter real tasks and watch them get processed through specialized minds
- See how reflection, planning, execution, and analysis work together
- Real-time visualization of the cognitive pipeline

### Example Tasks
- "Plan a weekend camping trip for 4 people"
- "Debug why my Python web app is running slowly" 
- "Write a creative story about an AI discovering emotions"
- "Analyze the pros and cons of remote work"

## Architecture

CRUX processes tasks through specialized cognitive minds:

1. **Reflection Mind** - Analyzes task complexity and approach
2. **Planning Mind** - Creates detailed execution strategies  
3. **Execution Mind** - Implements concrete solutions
4. **Analysis Mind** - Performs quality checks and recommendations
